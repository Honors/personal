Incumbent Authority
===================

	Tears on the mausoleum floor
	Blood stains the Colosseum doors
	Lies on the lips of a priest
	Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
	Rolling in Rolls Royce Corniche
	Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
	Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached
	Drug dealer chic, I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
	Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
	Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
	All for Plato, screech
	I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
	Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
	Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach 
		- Jay-Z, No Church in the Wild

In *No Church in the Wild*, Jay-Z asserts that the incumbent authorities of the world should not be blindly trusted, assumptions should be challenged. He begins with the contrasting image of kings being mourned with tears, and gladiators being forgotten over blood. These inequalities, he then asserts, are promoted by deceptive authority figures and blurred histories. It has gotten to a point where it is believed of his car that "Only the doctors got this", and so he has a hard time even convincing authority of his rightful ownership. He now begs the question, "Does God love thugs?" Having been judged and disregarded by authority his whole life he cannot be certain, are the incumbent powers justified? In pursuing this question, he turns to Socrates. He wonders whether one who is pious is loved by God, necessarily, and further, whether their piety is the cause or the effect. However, he reaches a dead end, it depends "whose bias ... y'all seek"; thus perhaps thugs are loved by God, and merely disregarded because of the bias of society. In a similar vein, he references the lowly profession of Christ, similar to that of Yeezy. He concludes that Yeezy is in fact a source of truth, and he, Hova, an advocate.
